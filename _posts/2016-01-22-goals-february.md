Some our plans for the immediate future:

* to expand the website to include an 'about the members' section
* to run a workshop on creating your own landing page (optional)
* to collect useful resources for the group in one place
* to think about where we would like to meet (do we want a computer lab/meeting room?)
* we have had some interest from researchers at other universities, and members of the public about getting involved in the group - how can we use this as an opportunity for engagement?
* think about how we will document our progress, which would help in attempting to secure future funding bids
* think about the types of workshops that we would like to run/attend in the future, and how we can organise this from within the group
