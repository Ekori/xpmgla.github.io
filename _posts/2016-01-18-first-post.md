XPMGla is a research cluster that aims to draw expertise from all areas of experimental Humanities-based scholarship in order to share
skills, gain new perspectives on research, and to work on
collaborative projects of an interdisciplinary nature.

The group runs in parallel with the [Experimental Methods in the
Humanities group](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/) at Columbia University, New York, with whom we intend to collaborate in areas such as
publishing, grant work, and symposia.


The group meets every second Friday, between 15:00 to 17:00, initially in the [STELLA lab](http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/itsupport/stella.html) at 13 University Gardens.

The sessions will provide an informal space for us to work on our
own projects in an engaging environment where ideas can be discussed
and explored, including opportunities for individuals to present
work and gain feedback from a broad range of subject specialists,
and potentially prompting avenues of collaboration and/or the
sharing of best practice. The sessions will, however, be malleable
to the needs of the group as we move forward.

Our introductory session will take place on 5th of February 2016. It will
involve some informal introductions, and a chance to start work on your individual or group project. We will also be going for a
drink afterwards at The Curler's Rest (we will probably continue
this tradition after each session).

To register interest in attending our introductory session on, or if
you have any questions, please email the group coordinators, Stuart
Purcell (s.purcell.1[at]research.gla.ac.uk) and Elina Koristashevskaya
(e.koristashevskaya.1[at]research.gla.ac.uk).



## Goals

Some our plans for the immediate future:

* to expand the website to include an 'about the members' section
* to run a workshop on creating your own landing page (optional)
* to collect useful resources for the group in one place
* to think about where we would like to meet (do we want a computer lab/meeting room?)
* we have had some interest from researchers at other universities, and members of the public about getting involved in the group - how can we use this as an opportunity for engagement?
* think about how we will document our progress, which would help in attempting to secure future funding bids
* think about the types of workshops that we would like to run/attend in the future, and how we can organise this from within the group
