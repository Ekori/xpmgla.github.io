XPMGla is a research cluster that aims to draw expertise from all areas of experimental Humanities-based scholarship in order to share
skills, gain new perspectives on research, and to work on
collaborative projects of an interdisciplinary nature.

The group runs in parallel with the [Experimental Methods in the
Humanities group](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/) at Columbia University, New York, with whom we intend to collaborate in areas such as
publishing, grant work, and symposia.


The group meets every second Friday, between 15:00 to 17:00, initially in the [STELLA lab](http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/itsupport/stella.html) at 13 University Gardens.

The sessions will provide an informal space for us to work on our
own projects in an engaging environment where ideas can be discussed
and explored, including opportunities for individuals to present
work and gain feedback from a broad range of subject specialists,
and potentially prompting avenues of collaboration and/or the
sharing of best practice. The sessions will, however, be malleable
to the needs of the group as we move forward.

Our introductory session will take place on 29th of January. It will
involve some informal introductions, and a chance to start work on your individual or group project. We will also be going for a
drink afterwards at The Curler's Rest (we will probably continue
this tradition after each session).

To register interest in attending our introductory session on, or if
you have any questions, please email the group coordinators, Stuart
Purcell (s.purcell.1[at]research.gla.ac.uk) and Elina Koristashevskaya
(e.koristashevskaya.1[at]research.gla.ac.uk).



## Timeline

Ideally there would be a projected timeline.
