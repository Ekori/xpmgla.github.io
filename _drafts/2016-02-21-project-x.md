Project X is a project. Here is a bit of **bold** text about the project. 
Here is a bit of *italicized* text. 
If you want to go crazy, you can use **_for both_**.

###Here is a subheading

>Here is a quote that someone had about the project

If you want to put some code inline, you would put `back-ticks around it`

If you want to insert some code with syntax highlighting, you can use a code block:

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
