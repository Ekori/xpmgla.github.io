If you are new to GitHub, make sure to read **[Adding a post using the web client pt.1]({{ site.url }}/guide-adding-a-post-1/)** and **[Adding a post using the web client pt.2]({{ site.url }}/guide-adding-a-post-2/)**.

##Step 3 - Saving and publishing your post

If you are at the stage where you are happy with the post that you are adding to your fork of the XPMGla page, you can save your new document by **committing** it. Once you've done this, you can **merge** your fork of XPMGla with the Original repository to add the post to the XPMGla website. Remember, the post won't be published until you request for your personal fork to be merged with the original (or **origin**).

###Saving (committing) your file

After you have finished your post, you will have to **commit** the new file. At the bottom of the page, you will see the options for committing your file:
