This is a guide written specifically for interacting with the **XPMGla GitHub**. If you would like a general introduction, there are plenty of great guides out there for getting to grips with Git and GitHub. [^1]

####Before you begin...

This guide assumes that you **already have a GitHub account**, but **don't have Git or the client installed on your machine**. 

It also assumes that you have gone through at least [**part 1 of the GitHub web interface**]({{ site.url }}/guide-adding-a-post-1/) guides. So, before you continue, make sure that you have:

1. An understanding of what a repo, fork and a branch is;
2. Forked from the main [XPMGla repo](https://github.com/xpmgla/xpmgla.github.io);
3. And possibly made some changes and submitting a pull request.

If that's not the case, have a look at parts [1]({{ site.url }}/guide-adding-a-post-1/), [2]({{ site.url }}/guide-adding-a-post-2/), and [3]({{ site.url }}/guide-adding-a-post-3/) of the guide here.


##Step 1 - Installing Git

Git and GitHub are not one and the same. You'll be using both to interact with the XPMGla repo. 

**Git** 'is a very popular and efficient open source Version Control System. It tracks content such as files and directories.'[^2] A good way to think about Git is as 'a series of snapshots (commits)' of any revisions you make to your files. You can examine these snapshots in the order they were created. You can make branches to experiment and come then return to earlier snapshots if you want.[^3]

**GitHub** 'is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.'[^4]

So, first you have to download and install Git. 

####Downloading Git

Start by going to the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and following the instructions there.




##Step 2- Installing GitHub

Downloading GitHub is pretty straightforward. GitHub recently released [**GitHub Desktop**](https://desktop.github.com/), which is an all-in-one client that works on both Windows and OSX.

Following the link above should take you the right page for installing GitHub Desktop for your operating system.
