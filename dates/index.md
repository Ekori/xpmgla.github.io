## Next meeting

The first meeting of the XPM Gla group will take place on the **5th of February, in the Stella Lab between 3 and 5pm**. We hope that anyone interested in joining the group will come along and introduce themselves, following which we will be going for a drink at the Curler's Rest, to which everyone is also welcome.

## Upcoming meetings

If you are not able to make the first meeting, please feel free to come along at a later date, or email one of the organisers if you'd like to contribute to the group offsite.

## Interesting events

Events that might be interesting to group members will be posted here, and everyone is welcome to contribute.
